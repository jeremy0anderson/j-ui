# React.js Navigation Component with various configurable options (Side menu + placement)

## Component: 
* First, make sure your CRA project has the following installed:
  * @mui/material
  * @mui/icons-material
  * @emotion/react
  * @emotion/styled
  * styled-components
  * framer-motion
  * react-router-dom
    * note: Navigation component will not render and you will get an error if your app isn't wrapped with the BrowserRouter component from react-router-dom as this component requires you provide text for any link options in the sidebar (small screen) and navbar (larger screen)

* Next, import {Components} from 'jda-ui'
* Then, const {...start typing -- all options are typed and suggestions should populate in your editor} = Components
